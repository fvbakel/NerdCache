The code in this repository can be used to find the "NerdCache".

## About this program

More information on the background of this program can be found at [geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/). 

## Pre conditions

This program is designed to run on multiple operating systems, including [HumanOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain). On most operating systems [Python3](https://www.python.org/) is required to run this program and [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is required for the installation. 
However on HumanOs other software and information might be required to install and run. The paragraphs below describe how to install and run this program on different operating systems.

## Run on Linux

[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

Most Linux distributions have Python3 and git installed by default. Take the following steps to install and run this program on Linux.

0. Make sure git and Python are installed
1. Open a terminal
2. Install the program, type in the terminal: `git checkout https://github.com/fvbakel/NerdCache.git`
3. To run the program: 
```bash
cd NerdCache
python nerdcache.py
```

The program will have the following output:[geocaching.com/](https://www.geocaching.com/)

## Run on Windows

[Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), commonly referred to as Windows, is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. 

Windows does not have Python3 and git installed by default. Take the following steps to install and run this program on Windows.

0. Make sure git and Python are installed
1. Open a command prompt
2. Install the program, type in the terminal: `git checkout https://github.com/fvbakel/NerdCache.git`
3. To run the program: 
```bash
cd NerdCache
python nerdcache.py
```

The program will have the following output:
```bash
Congratulations, you found the cache!
```

## Run on macOS

[macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) (previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is a proprietary graphical operating system developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers.

macOS does not have Python3 and git installed by default. Take the following steps to install and run this program on macOs.

0. Make sure git and Python are installed
1. Open a terminal
2. Install the program, type in the terminal: `git checkout https://github.com/fvbakel/NerdCache.git`
3. To run the program: 
```bash
cd NerdCache
python nerdcache.py
```

The program will have the following output:
```bash
Congratulations, you found the cache!
```

## Run on HumanOs

The Human Operating system ([HumanOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain))comes in many different versions and installations. In fact, each installation is unique. Therefor it is very difficult to tell how this program can be run on your copy of HumanOs. Some versions of HumanOs are able to run this program without any further modules installed or already have all the required software and information installed to run. Below is a list of common modules that might be required to install on your copy of HumanOs:

- careful-reading
- common-sense
- walk
- basic-math
- Dutch-grid
- see
- analytical-skill
- humor
- little-fantasy
- basic-geocaching

Furthermore, it is required to have GPS or smartphone hardware attached.

Take the following steps to install and run this program on HumanOs:

1. Open a browser and navigate to [github.com/fvbakel/NerdCache](https://github.com/fvbakel/NerdCache)
2. HumanOs will now automatically install and run this program

If modules are missing then HumanOs will automatically try and install the additional software that is required. Some versions seem to run into the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) during this phase. If your copy of HumanOs will run into this condition can not be predicted. Some versions of HumanOs seem to halt because they can not run this program on their own. They can however run this program in a [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster).

It is difficult to predict what the output of the program will be on your copy of HumanOs. Since there are so many different versions of HumanOs the output might be very different in each case. However it is known that this program might cause the following programs to run at the same time or after this program is run:

- frustration
- crazy
- enjoy
- happy
- smile

Please let me know the output of this program on your copy of HumanOs on [geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/).
